Log created. Should have been created sooner.
I think we have reached the maximum potentiel of my previous algorithm.
It isn't fast enough, however, results are overwhelming, as it can restitute the sixteenth dominant colors of an image.

# New technique: DB-SCAN.

I have to create a list of the distances between the points of the images. How long does it takes?
Then, it needs to be sorted, and we need to take epsilon = 0.1% of all distances.
--> Find a better way to determine epsilon and minpts !

Launch algorithm with minpts varying. How long is the algorithm, and what minpts works best?

Main file split in 3 different ones to separate functions and core program.
Works well. 
Need to make a function to tell time left, and start dbscan analysis!

Corrections made to the image_processing library.
I need to update the code without using Pixel class.
I need to import an image directly as an array and work on that, it will be a lot simpler afterwards.

--> pixels = np.asarray(PIL.Image.open('pathtotheimage'))
im = PIL.Image.fromarray(numpy.uint8(I))
